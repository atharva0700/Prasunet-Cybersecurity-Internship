Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of five projects I have developed in the field of cybersecurity. 
Each project demonstrates various aspects of security practices, from encryption techniques to network analysis. Explore the code and insights behind each project, 
and see how they contribute to building a safer digital world.

Projects Included,

Pixel Manipulation: A project exploring steganography by hiding information within images.

Caesar Cipher: An implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique.

Password Complexity Checker: A tool to assess and enhance the complexity of passwords.

Key Logger: A keylogging application for monitoring keystrokes (for educational purposes).

Network Packet Analyzer: Analyzing network traffic to identify potential security threats.
